# Foxkov
Foxkov is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain](Markov chain) toolset for natural language. By default it is primed to use exports from [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)(I am not affiliated with their political beliefs it just works.) but configuration is available.

Have fun.
